# AllThingsDonation
Inspiration
The large number of wastes worldwide has become bigger and bigger, and with this you often see people throwing away furniture, clothes, books, which could be reused.

On the other hand, there are several people who do not have a table, chairs, sofa, bed and the like, or who are moving or starting their lives and are unable to invest or need to save.

With an addendum that the unbridled disposal in many cities or countries affects the balance of nature, increases the risk of floods and landslides, among many other things.

AllThingsDonation was made based on some ideals, such as: Reuse of materials, social support through community donation, Environmental preservation and reduction of waste, incentive to charity, social support, and some others.

What it does
How many times have we discarded something because it took up space, no longer served us or because we simply didn't want it anymore? But for someone else, in many cases, it still has use, and it's a real treasure for this one.

AllThingsDonation serves precisely to bring these people together.

But when more than one person wants that item, our raffle system will take care of it, and the winner will receive it.

In addition, charities have priority, so if they need to, they can request this one, without the need for a draw and being at the front of the queue.

How we built it
Four beginner Design and Development students came together to build this project, and with that, AllThingsDonation was born. Mainly using Figma, HTML and CSS.

Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was the time zone, each one had a different time zone, where there were people with 2, 3 and 5 hours of difference, ahead, compared to the hackathon.

But like any good team, we overcame this problem and did our best.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of the team we formed, where unknown people came together for a common cause.

One of the team members does not have all her furniture at home, as she is starting her professional journey and is still looking for a job, in addition to the fact that people close to her lost everything or almost everything, some including their homes, in a flood that occurred last year, and with that this project means a lot to her and the team, and we are proud of that.

What we learned
We learned to form, align ourselves and work as a team, even with unknown people in a few hours, in addition to being able to develop a little more in Figma and in website development.

What's next for AllThingsDonation
For the next steps of the project, we want to be able to finish it. Because initially we will use forms for registration, but in the future we want to develop a user tab with greater quality, where you can register, log in and access your profile, donating or requesting a donation on the website itself.
